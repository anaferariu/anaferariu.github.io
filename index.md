## About
I am a PhD student at Drexel University working at the intersection of machine learning, statistics, and biomedical and behavioral research. My work focuses on modeling heterogeneity in health outcomes, identifying subgroups with distinct risk or treatment response profiles, and developing interpretable predictive models for complex, high-dimensional and longitudinal data.

I primarily work in **R** and **Python**, with experience in tree-based models, regularized regression, ensemble learning, and model interpretability methods.
