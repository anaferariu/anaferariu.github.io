## About Me
I am a PhD student researcher at Drexel University, under the supervision of Dr. Fengqing (Zoe) Zhang, working at the intersection of statistical methods and machine learning, with applications in clinical and developmental populations. I previously completed a MS in Statistics at Lehigh University and a BS in Mathematics at Drexel University. During my undergraduate studies, I was also a member of Drexel’s D1 women’s basketball team and represented Romania on the Olympic women’s basketball team.

My research interests center on longitudinal modeling, latent class analysis, and predictive modeling, with a particular focus on using machine learning and deep learning approaches to characterize substance use trajectories across adolescent neurodevelopment. I have also worked on projects applying subgroup identification methods in randomized controlled trials of behavioral weight-loss interventions.

In the industry setting, I have experience transforming unstructured clinical text into actionable insights for downstream analysis, which has given me exposure to working on data-driven products from early design through deployment.

## Work Experience

### Proscia, Inc. — AI and Data Science Intern
*Summer 2025 | Supervisors: Corey Chivers, PhD & Ajay Basavanhally, PhD*

At Proscia, I contributed to the development of applied machine learning and natural language processing methods for transforming unstructured pathology and clinical text into structured, queryable patient-level data within a production healthcare analytics platform [Proscia's Aperture](https://proscia.com/aperture/). Beyond model development, I played a role in shaping core modeling decisions by identifying gaps in existing product workflows, reframing them as concrete research problems, and designing statistically principled solutions that were adopted in practice. My work emphasized the full pipeline from idea to deployment, including building reproducible prototypes, validating model behavior, documenting failure modes, and collaborating closely with engineers to operationalize methods under real-world constraints. These contributions continue to support scalable analytics pipelines that extract clinically meaningful insights from large collections of medical records on a daily basis.

### Division of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics — Jefferson University
*June 2024 – August 2024 | Supervisor: Inna Chervoneva, PhD*

At the Division of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics at Thomas Jefferson University, I worked on the analysis of high-dimensional imaging data to identify prognostic biomarkers for lung cancer. My work involved comparing machine learning approaches with classical statistical methods for survival analysis, including the use of functional regression to model complex imaging-derived features. I also participated in protocol review meetings for oncologic clinical trials, which provided exposure to the design, oversight, and regulatory considerations involved in translational cancer research.
