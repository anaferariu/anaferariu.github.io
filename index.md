## About
I am a PhD student at Drexel University working at the intersection of machine learning, statistics, and biomedical and behavioral research. My work focuses on modeling heterogeneity in health outcomes, identifying subgroups with distinct risk or treatment response profiles, and developing interpretable predictive models for complex, high-dimensional and longitudinal data.

I primarily work in **R** and **Python**, with experience in tree-based models, regularized regression, ensemble learning, and model interpretability methods.

## Work Experience

### Quantitative Psychology and Statistics Lab — Drexel University
*September 2022 – Present | Supervisor: Fengqing (Zoe) Zhang, PhD*
* Lead quantitative analyst on ABCD neuroimaging and behavioral datasets (over 10,000 participants), integrating
multimodal MRI, behavioral, and clinical variables.
* Applied advanced machine learning methods (e.g., neural nets, interpretable models, ensemble learning) to model brain
network structure and predict early substance use trajectories over time.
* Designed and implemented statistical models including latent class analysis and multilevel modeling to uncover
developmental patterns and unobserved subgroups.
* Developed and validated explainable AI pipelines for predicting early alcohol use trajectories from multimodal
neuroimaging features in the ABCD dataset.
* Collaborated with interdisciplinary teams of statisticians, neuroscientists, and clinicians to translate machine learning
findings into developmental neuroscience insights.
* Led subgroup identification analyses in a behavioral weight-loss trial, using qualitative interaction modeling to uncover
participant characteristics associated with differential response to mindfulness- and acceptance-based components.

### Proscia, Inc. — AI and Data Science Intern
*June 2025 – October 2025 | Supervisors: Corey Chivers, PhD & Ajay Basavanhally, PhD*
* Contributed to ML/NLP methods that transformed unstructured clinical text into structured, queryable data for a production healthcare analytics platform.
* Identified gaps in product workflows, framed them as research problems, and developed statistically rigorous solutions adopted in real-world systems.
* Translated advanced modeling into deployed capabilities by building reproducible prototypes and collaborating with engineers to operationalize methods.
* Developed scalable analytics pipelines that extract medical insights from thousands of records daily.


### Division of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics — Jefferson University
*June 2024 – August 2024 | Supervisor: Inna Chervoneva, PhD*
* Analyzed high-dimensional imaging data to identify biomarkers for lung cancer prognosis.
* Evaluated machine learning vs. classical statistical methods for survival analysis.
* Attended Protocol Review Meetings for clinical trials of oncologic pharmaceuticals.
